        In GrowTavern, a quick way to make a profit is to farm rock for ore. Each type of ore has a different price depending on the type, and the ore can be sold to get World Locks (WL), Diamond Locks (DL), or Blue Gem Locks (BGL). In addition, ore can also be used as the main ingredient for making pickaxes, which is useful for increasing farming efficiency. So, by constantly farming and collecting ore, players can make in-game money quickly and effectively.
